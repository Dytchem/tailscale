Private WireGuard® networks made easy

## Overview

This repository contains the majority of Tailscale's open source code.
Notably, it includes the `tailscaled` daemon and
the `tailscale` CLI tool. The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,
[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees
on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo's
code, but this repo doesn't contain the mobile GUI code.

Other [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:

* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android
* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology
* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg
* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey

For background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,

## Dytchem Fork — Connection Preference

This fork adds `--connection-preference` / `TS_CONNECTION_PREFERENCE` to
control the priority ordering of connection methods (direct UDP, DERP relay,
peer relay). Unlike upstream Tailscale's automatic path selection, this allows
exact specification of which connection methods to use and in what order.

```
tailscaled --connection-preference=derp:902,derp:*,direct
```

### Syntax

- `direct` — Direct UDP only
- `derp:<region_id>` — Specific DERP region (e.g. `derp:902`)
- `derp:*` — Any DERP region
- `peer-relay` — Peer relay (Geneve-encapsulated)

Comma-separated ordered list. When a single method is specified, no fallback
to other methods occurs. Multiple methods create a priority chain.

### Example: Force DERP 902 only

```
tailscaled --connection-preference=derp:902
```

The node will exclusively use DERP region 902, refusing direct connections
and other DERP regions. Verified on Linux (userspace-networking) and FreeBSD
with three exit nodes in production.

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).

## Other clients

The [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)
use the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI
wrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves
not open source.

## Building

We always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.26. (While we build
releases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not
required.)

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

If you're packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`
instead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:

```
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

If your distro has conventions that preclude the use of
`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your
distro's way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).

## Contributing

PRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference
bugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).

We require [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.

See [commit-messages.md](docs/commit-messages.md) (or skim `git log`) for our commit message style.
